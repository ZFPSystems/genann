| Genann Library builder for Acorn/ROOL DDE
| By Paolo Fabio Zaino

| Set the following variables to match your building configuration:

| *** BEGIN StubG-ness (here only for historical reasons, ignore it)
| This is for compatibility with the past work I did on this lib.
| Please, please, please, if you don't know what StubG is just don't use it
| leave the above and the StubG make below commented out, your life
| will be fine, mine will be too.
|Set StubG$Dir  &.AcornC/C++.Export.StubG.Libraries.clib | If you want to do 26/32bit indipendent builds you MUST use StubG
							| To use stubG you have to download the latest from RISC OS Ltd (it's a Zip file)
							| at the moment of writing this the latest release is 0.04 and can be found here:
							| http://riscos.com/support/developers/stubg/index.html
							| download it, unzip it somewhere and then use the path where you unzipped it to
							| populate the StubG$Dir value above.
|Set StubG$Path <StubG$Dir>.
|*** End of StubG-ness a memory from the past...


| Temporarly set this directory as root
Set Return$Dir &
Dir <Obey$Dir>

| Make the Library
WimpSlot -min 1024k

| Please note: If you want to rebuild the Library on your system then
|              uncomment one of the lines below corresponding to your
|              desired ARM Architecture and RISC OS APCS version.
|
|              If you want to build a StubG release (aka universal)
|              then uncomment the line here below with MakeFileDDESG

| Make DDE StubG
| should work on everything as long as your RO has the right CLib
| (may requires !System provided by ROOL)
| For applications that should run everywhere it's probably a good
| idea to use this one
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE


|
| 32bit support:
|

| Make DDE 32bit APCS 3 version
| good for: RO5.x on all 32bit ARMs
| (requires !System provided by ROOL)
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE32

| Make DDE 32bit APCS 3 version
| Should optimize for: RO5.x on Iyonix
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE32ARMv5

| Make DDE 32bit APCS 3
| Should optimize for: RPi 1
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE32ARMv6

| Make DDE 32bit APCS 3
| Should optimize for: RPi 2
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE32ARMv7

| Make DDE 32bit APCS 3
| Should optimize for: RPi 3
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE32ARMv8


|
| 26bit support:
|

| Make DDE 26bit APCS 3 version
| Should optimize for: RO3.xy/RO4.xy on
|                      ARM6xx/ARM7xx
|                      may work on ARM3 too
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE26

| Make DDE 26bit APCS 3 version and
| optimize code for ARMv2
| Should optimize for: RO3.x with ARM2,
|                      ARM250 or ARM3 CPUs.
| (this is for old Archimedes and Acorn Axxxx series)
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE26ARMv2

| Make DDE 26bit APCS 3 version
| Should Optimize for: RO4.x with StrongARM
amu THROWBACK=-throwback -f MakeFileDDE26ARMv4


|
| Final tocuhes:
|

| Copy library header:
IfThere @.h.genann Then copy @.h.genann @.^.h.genann F ~C

| Reset
