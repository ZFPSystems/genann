Genann Neural Network Library port to RISC OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DISCLAIMER
This is a port to RISC OS of a C library called Genann (read the intro for more details). The library was ported to RISC OS by Paolo Fabio Zaino.
By downloading and using this library you accept the license and the terms of use:
The library and all the code and info in this repository are provided as is and I am not liable for any issue/problems you may have using this library.

INTRO
This is the RISC OS port of Genann library, a minimal, well-tested C library for training and using feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The primary focus of the original Genann library is to be simple, fast, reliable and hackable, all stuff that is focus of RISC OS as well so I thought the two would match wonderfuly and it seems they do.

I have put attention to make sure Genann works on both Acorn/ROOL DDE and GCC for RISC OS, so you are free to choose your favorite compiler as well as being able to use Genann also on old Acorn Archimedes, Acorn A series and Acorn RiscPC for the retrocoders among you.

Genann is also threadsafe so, in theory, you could use it with libraries like !Vista in Acorn/ROOL DDE C++ as well as with PThreads on GCC.

HOW TO USE IT
Look at the various example code in the GenannExamples directory, they can be executed and they also come with source code to look at (from the original Genann authors, I just ported the code to compile and work on RISC OS).

For more info look at the README/MD in the !Genann directory.

There is also a test suite that will provide you with a raw performance analisys and full functionality test of the library on your specific platform, look in GenannTests for it.

Enjoy!
